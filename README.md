## Currently a Work in Progress.



Data Gathering : Python
Visualization : Angular

## Data Source

- OKex (Probably easy, since they provide these data.)
- BitMex (Hard, they don't provide these data, need bot to analyze on the order book. Probably the last one to implement)
- Bitfinex (Relatively easy, they do expose some of the data, check the link below.)
